        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">MarketingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Rachel is currently a first year student studying Business at the University of California, Riverside. She is studying towards a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing. In the future, she hopes to pursue a marketing related position in the beauty industry where she will be able to work alongside her colleagues in preparing releases and ideas for new beauty products. Her love and interest for beauty stemmed at a young age through frequently watching Youtube videos that taught her how to apply makeup. With this passion, she hopes to apply it to her lifelong career as it will ensure that she will be working towards something that she loves. Currently on campus, Rachel is involved in various social organizations. These include Alpha Delta Pi, a greek sorority focused on helping low-income families at the Ronald McDonald House, and Vietnamese Student Association, a cultural and social club that allows students to interact at various events with another. Besides her engagement with organizations, Rachel hopes to participate in campus planning for concerts through ASPB in the future.<br><br>

        Through her participation in school clubs, internships, and jobs, Rachel has been able to gain a multitude of skills to prepare her in effectively working in different environments. Her skills include teamwork and leadership skills gained from previous volunteer and club experience, punctuality, and easy to interact with. Alongside these skills, Rachel is also a quick learner and through this has learned to easily adapt to new, unknown environments. Being Vietnamese-Amercian, Rachel is also fluent in both English and Vietnamese, which can be very useful in working with various business partners around the globe. In high school, her extracurricular activities included being in the dance team, serving as a secretary, treasurer, and publicist for multiple clubs at school, and playing violin in the school orchestra. Out of all of her past activities, Rachelâ€™s favorite activity by far is serving as a link crew leader at her highschool. Through this experience, she served as a mentor for incoming freshman by providing them with guidance, offering advice, and answering any of their concerns about academics or highschool life in general. She believes that because of this opportunity she was able to improve on her listening skills and allowing others to speak first before offering upon her own judgement for them to take away. Music has always been a large part of Rachelâ€™s life as she began playing piano at a young age and soon moved onto to violin where she found the most passion for music. With her love for violin, she progressed to complete her violin certification of merit up to level 8. <br><br>

        In her work experience, Rachel has worked as a brand representation for the retail company Hollister Co. During this job, she has gained a large amount of customer service skills through addressing customerâ€™s shopping needs, compiling outfits to find what they are looking for, and helping them find the correct sizing. Alongside customer service, Rachel also worked as a cashier at this store where she would help customers sign up for a rewards programs, offer them deals, and thank them for coming at the end of their purchase.<br><br>
